# Build file for the Repy runtime that the custominstallerbuilder requires. 
# (Essentially identical with repy_v2's config_build.txt).
#
# If it were not for the problems with repyportability / repyhelper / 
# dylink, the custominstallerbuilder code could do plain Python `import`'s 
# from Repy files, and be done. Since that doesn't work currently, 
# we build a directory containing the full runtime instead.
#
# Contributors please note:
# Be sure to revisit this workaround whenever progress is made on 
# SeattleTestbed/portability#25 through 28!
